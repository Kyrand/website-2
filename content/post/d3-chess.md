I needed a chess-viewer for a larger data-viz project I'm working
on ( [see here]({{< ref "/post/d3-chess-css3d" >}}) ) and D3 seemed like the perfect tool for the job. The viewer takes lists of
moves (SAN format) and creates an animated play. It could be a nice base for
something more full-featured. Once again I was impressed by how easy D3 makes
this kind of project.
