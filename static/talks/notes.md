## Proposals


### To the Web and Beyond

Working from the premise that the fruits of your data explorations find their natural home on the web, this talk will discuss a few modern work-flows that deliver your data to the browser. I'll be aiming to distil a few of the things I learned in the last year while writing the book 'Data-visualisation with Python and JavaScript' and highlighting some of the key changes that have occurred in the Python and JS dataviz ecosystems in that little time.  

If you take dataviz seriously I think you have to engage and make friends with JavaScript. The good news for Pythonistas is that Modern JS (EcmaScript 6) has 'borrowed' more than a few of Python's clothes, which makes moving between the two languages that much easier. I'll demonstrate a few of these, showing bilingual development is getting less and less arduous.
